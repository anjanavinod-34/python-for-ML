### Unsupervised Learning: Extracting Insights without Labels

In the realm of machine learning, unsupervised learning stands out for its ability to glean valuable insights from unlabelled data. Let's explore some core concepts and applications along with practical examples:

#### Core Concepts:

1. **Clustering Algorithms**: Algorithms like K-means, Hierarchical Clustering, and DBSCAN autonomously partition data into clusters based on similarities, aiding exploratory analysis.

2. **Dimensionality Reduction Techniques**: Techniques such as PCA, t-SNE, and Autoencoders condense high-dimensional data while preserving structure for visualization and feature extraction.

3. **Anomaly Detection**: Algorithms like Isolation Forest identify outliers crucial for applications like fraud detection and fault diagnosis.

4. **Association Rule Learning**: Algorithms like Apriori uncover associations between variables, valuable for market basket analysis and biological sequence mining.

#### Applications:

1. **Customer Segmentation**: Algorithms segment customers based on purchasing behavior or demographics, enabling targeted marketing campaigns and personalized recommendations.

   ```python
   # Example: K-means Clustering
   from sklearn.cluster import KMeans
   import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
   
   # Generate sample data
   X = [[1, 2], [1, 4], [1, 0],
        [10, 2], [10, 4], [10, 0]]
   
   # Fit K-means clustering
   kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=2, random_state=0).fit(X)
   
   # Plot clustered data
   plt.scatter([x[0] for x in X], [x[1] for x in X], c=kmeans.labels_, cmap='viridis')
   plt.scatter(kmeans.cluster_centers_[:, 0], kmeans.cluster_centers_[:, 1], marker='x', c='r', s=100)
   plt.title('K-means Clustering')
   plt.xlabel('Feature 1')
   plt.ylabel('Feature 2')
   plt.show()

## Anomaly Detection

Anomaly detection algorithms play a critical role in cybersecurity by identifying unusual network traffic patterns, crucial for detecting security breaches.

### Example: Isolation Forest for Anomaly Detection

```python
from sklearn.ensemble import IsolationForest
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Generate sample data
rng = np.random.RandomState(42)
X = 0.3 * rng.randn(100, 2)
X_train = np.r_[X + 2, X - 2]

# Fit Isolation Forest
clf = IsolationForest(random_state=rng).fit(X_train)

# Predict anomalies
y_pred = clf.predict(X_train)

# Plot anomalies
plt.scatter(X_train[:, 0], X_train[:, 1], c=y_pred, cmap='viridis')
plt.title('Isolation Forest: Anomaly Detection')
plt.xlabel('Feature 1')
plt.ylabel('Feature 2')
plt.show()
