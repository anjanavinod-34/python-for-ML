# Report on Student Behaviour Analysis

## 1. Overview:
The dataset contains information about students including their gender, nationality, semester, parent answering survey, student absence days, and grade ID. We conducted an analysis to understand the distribution and trends within the dataset.

## 2. Gender Distribution:
- Gender distribution analysis reveals that there are two categories: male and female.
- Approximately 52.47% of the students are male, and 47.53% are female.
- The gender distribution is visually represented through both a countplot and a pie chart. 

## 3. Parent Answering Survey:
- Parent answering survey analysis indicates whether parents have participated in surveys.
- About 51.02% of parents have participated, while 48.98% have not.
- The distribution is depicted through both a countplot and a pie chart.

## 4. Student Absence Days:
- Student absence days analysis provides insights into the number of days students were absent.
- The majority of students (66.84%) were absent less than 7 days, while 33.16% were absent more than 7 days.
- Visualization of the distribution is shown using both a count plot and a pie chart.

## 5. Conclusion:
- The dataset provides valuable insights into student demographics and behavior.
- Gender distribution shows a slightly higher presence of males.
- A significant portion of parents have participated in surveys, indicating active involvement in their children's education.
- Most students have been absent for fewer than 7 days, suggesting good attendance rates.

## 6. Recommendations:
- Further analysis could be conducted to understand the correlation between variables such as student absence days and academic performance.
- It would be beneficial to collect additional data on student performance metrics to identify any patterns or trends.

This report summarizes the key findings from the analysis of the provided dataset. Further exploration and analysis can provide deeper insights into student behavior and academic outcomes.
